Here you can look back to Inspiration Point and see the thick layer of white limestone you were just standing upon. At this point of the plateau rim, that layer has been eroded away, and you are standing on the more iron-rich layers of limestone, mudstone, and sandstone from which hoodoos are being formed.

See how the fins are left standing at the edge of the rim, and as your eyes sweep east you can see small windows within them formed by the power of ice. These windows eventually enlarge until two spires are left on either side of them--hoodoos--which then wear down into colorful hills. The exposed roots of the limber pine beside this view are a great visual of how the rim erodes back 1-4 feet every 100 years to expose these rocks.

Today, the simple marker offers a glimpse into a larger, more detailed and complicated story than its plain inscription would suggest.","assetId":"EDE741A0-258B-4A5E-8239-583D2940FDDD","assetName":"Bettin Oak Monument","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"E433FB2E-F82D-632D-BC8A559759783D40","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"\"Park and Peek\" Quick Driving Tour","topics":[{"id":"F3883A66-A7CB-461B-868E-1B5932224B25","name":"American Revolution"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"BEB7E470-13B2-4E00-84B2-0402D98DAF69","name":"Monuments and Memorials"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"990E22A2-20D8-4CC2-8E6C-D2DF165BCDA5","name":"American Revolutionary War"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"},{"id":"C8F98B28-3C10-41AE-AA99-092B3B398C43","name":"Museum Exhibits"}],"description":"Fort McHenry served three major roles during the American Civil War: an active garrison, a hospital, and a prison.

Lawmakers put forth legislation that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, credit, and public accommodations.  After 17 years, the law finally passed in 1989. In the subsequent fight for Marriage Equality, the State House, both inside and out, once again became a battleground. Inside, political leaders debated both for and against same-sex marriage. Outside, supporters and opponents rallied and protested in huge numbers.  In 2003, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled that banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.  While many gathered at the State House to protest this ruling, thousands turned out here to celebrate this milestone victory.","assetId":"BE126BB7-DF9E-4B75-926D-1266526767BB","assetName":"Massachusetts State House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/D83E2F94-9A20-27C2-0EBE2D29E1C6D3C6.mp3","id":"6D7FBB69-AA38-25CA-D7D30B0A8F26845B","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"At the home of social reformers Samuel Gridley and Julia Ward Howe we can look at the small, not often discussed, queer community within the wealthy white neighborhood of 1800s Beacon Hill. \n\nIn the 1800s, queer relationships looked and were defined very differently than they are today. The ambiguous intimate relationships between people of the same sex back then are often described as “Romantic Friendships.” These relationships often blurred the lines between romantic and platonic love.  \n\nBased on what records are available, Senator Charles Sumner appears to have been in a “Romantic Friendship” with Samuel Gridley Howe.

Gay bars like this offered some of the only public places where queer people could meet each other. \n\nThough the threat of police raids was ever-present, bars such as Sporters were important to the formation of a collective identity and were instrumental in shaping the LGBTQ+ community as we know it today.  \n\nBy the 1980s and 90s, the gay community in Beacon Hill had mostly disappeared, moving to trendier parts of the city.

Both Navajo Mountain and the Henry Mountains were formed by liquid magma that pushed up through the sedimentary rock layers as part of the forces that uplifted this region over the last 20 million years. The magma never erupted on the surface, but instead bowed the layers of rock above, forming blister-like mountains called \"laccoliths\".

The broad, sloping valley to the north of you currently drains to Sheep Creek, but on the other side of the cliffs right of it, tributaries of Willis Creek are steadily encroaching. Someday soon, the Willis Creek drainage will begin to divert water through a process called \"stream piracy\". This is when a river drainage system or watershed is diverted from its own bed, and flows instead down the bed of a neighboring stream.

Most of the plateau rim in this park is a watershed, and only rain and snow that fall directly into the amphitheaters will drain east into the Paria Valley toward the Colorado River. All the rain and snow that falls on top of the plateau actually joins the Sevier River, which drains north and then west toward Nevada. You can see the Sevier River flowing alongside Highway 89 to the west. This phenomenon is essential to hoodoo formation--if all that plateau precipitation instead flowed over the rim, the soft limestones would be worn down quickly rather than allowing the power of ice to leave them standing as it intricately breaks them apart.","assetId":"61EB89D9-56B2-4336-992D-566AE4849C62","assetName":"Swamp Canyon","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/EF555549-D2E2-3D55-E9FA7A3457AF34E8.mp3","id":"BEDB0C47-B041-C375-7837DD2C47792859","ordinal":"9","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Welcome to Bryce Point, perhaps the most iconic view in the entire park.

Over the last 6 million years, the Paria River has pushed north to form the valley east of the park.

One of the most enjoyable aspect of Inspiration Point is the opportunity to walk upon the \"White Member\" of the Claron formation--the more pure limestones, contrasted with the \"Pink Member\" of the more iron rich rocks further below.

All of these layers were formed around 40 million years ago in a freshwater lake. Due to fluctuations in the lake level, rocks of different hardness were deposited in sequence, creating the uneven shapes of both the fins and hoodoos you see here.

One of them was William Beckett, who was listed as being an invaluable part of the nursery business Peirce ran. Beckett was adept with driving horses and was reported to have been a coachman to several prominent politicians in his early years. After emancipation, Joshua Peirce paid Beckett wages to continue working on the estate in support of the nursery business. When Joshua Peirce died in the late 1860s, he bequeathed Mr. Beckett $3,000. Beckett used the money to start a successful coal and lumber business in downtown Washington, DC. Beckett may also have been made the coachman to President Cleveland in 1895. \n\nBy 1900, William was no longer driving carriages and became a doorman for the Library of Congress for the next decade. In late 1910 he suffered a fall and unfortunately passed away in 1911.

Though James' name disappears from the record, George can be traced through Freedman's bank records and through the documents filed by Isaac Peirce's grandson, Peirce Shoemaker, for compensated emancipation. George's family remained in the area, settling in several homes in the Reno City community area (now Tenleytown). George's grandson, Frank Brooks, lived on Broad Branch Road.

The Haydens notably assisted in high-profile Fugitive Slave Law cases, helping William and Ellen Craft as well as Shadrach Minkins on their journeys to freedom. In addition to their Underground Railroad work, Lewis and Harriet played other prominent roles in the community. Lewis served as Grand Master of the Prince Hall Masons, presided over numerous community meetings, and participated in the Equal Schools movement. During the Civil War, he recruited Black soldiers for the Massachusetts regiments. Following the War, Lewis Hayden served as one of the first Black members of the state legislature and, along with Harriet, lent his support in the fight for women’s suffrage.","assetId":"44F25E6F-FF69-49DB-8E82-8D5FB6A561D5","assetName":"Lewis and Harriet Hayden House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/7159567F-9D3F-A378-6A48AF202CCDE6F5.mp3","id":"F639FA0F-FB54-879A-A327F6EA6681264C","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Clothes dealer and community activist John P. Coburn and his family lived at this home beginning in 1844. In addition to his clothing shop, limited evidence suggests that Coburn may have ran a gaming house for wealthy Bostonians in his house. Coburn served as the treasurer of the New England Freedom Association, an organization dedicated to assisting freedom seekers who escaped slavery and came to Boston on the Underground Railroad. In 1851, authorities arrested, though later acquitted, Coburn for his alleged role in aiding in the courthouse rescue of Shadrach Minkins. Along with other community leaders in the 1850s, Coburn founded the Massasoit Guards, an unsanctioned Black militia. Militia groups such the Massasoit Guards can be considered precursors to the Black Civil War regiments, including the famous 54th Massachusetts. Coburn died in 1873 and his home passed to his son Wendell, whose widow, Mary, lived in the house until the turn of the twentieth century.","assetId":"32561E08-E923-46EF-88CF-4AA0B3248AB6","assetName":"John Coburn House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/69D95FF8-CD0D-34CE-653AA4353C3FDB3C.mp3","id":"F65A833D-CF95-210F-CEE01D67B752D83A","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"As home to the African Meeting House and the Abiel Smith School, Smith Court served as a vital center of African American life and culture for much of the nineteenth and earlier twentieth century in Boston.

Residents of 3 Smith Court, James Scott and William Cooper Nell, both sheltered freedom seekers in the 1850s. In 1849, George Washington purchased 5 Smith Court. He served as deacon of the First Independent Baptist Church at the African Meeting House. Built in 1799, 7A Smith Court is the only surviving example of the early homes that lined Holmes Alley.

William Cooper Nell led the charge against the segregated Smith School, facing opposition from Whites and well as from some in his own community. Over the course of more than 15 years, through a series of local petitions, protests, court cases, and ultimately a state-wide petition, Nell and others successfully convinced the legislature to outlaw public school segregation in 1855.

The Meeting House also served as a gathering space for social activism.

By the 1890s, the army replaced an expanded wooden pier with a rail system to move submarine mines and their accompanying materials on and off the dock. \n\nBuilt in 1906, the Visitor Center originally served as a storehouse for the submarine mines that played a critical role in the defense of Boston Harbor.

There were many others, and there continue to be more.\nWhat memory does the monument echo to you?\nWhat does it hold for the future?","assetId":"27EBF851-37AB-4F4E-AA50-9BEDD914F0CC","assetName":"Bunker Hill Museum","assetType":"visitorcenters","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/E6AAEB54-B468-4815-D07CCD469D2B6508.mp3","id":"7A3ACA22-B7BF-7DC3-5E1DFD6283ED448A","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Bunker Hill Monument: Remembering Revolution","topics":[{"id":"28AEAE85-9DDA-45B6-981B-1CFCDCC61E14","name":"African American Heritage"},{"id":"F3883A66-A7CB-461B-868E-1B5932224B25","name":"American Revolution"},{"id":"D9FC6D14-F8C7-4EBA-86EA-DFD99B6BB4F5","name":"Enslavement"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"BEB7E470-13B2-4E00-84B2-0402D98DAF69","name":"Monuments and Memorials"},{"id":"40C0866A-3890-41A4-84CA-5935DEE181AE","name":"Social Movements"},{"id":"5CCB14BC-2AC4-45CE-B786-54A065DA1B60","name":"Abolition Movement"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"990E22A2-20D8-4CC2-8E6C-D2DF165BCDA5","name":"American Revolutionary War"}]},{"activities":[],"description":"The CCC Spur Trail is a 0.2 mile long hiking trail that takes visitors through the woodlands surrounding the bayou, ending at an outlook point that faces the water.

Only a handful of buildings existed during the first 12 years. During the War of 1812, the Navy expanded the Yard to keep up with defense and technological change. At that time, carpenters built the ships of wood, caulkers waterproofed the hulls with rope \u0026 tar, and riggers organized a complicated network of ropes and sails to propel the ships forward. Over the next 130 years the Navy Yard demolished what was obsolete. The Navy constructed replacement facilities and purchased new technology when practical. By 1943, the Yard employed some 50,000 workers. Every day, men and women welded metal, forged steel, fabricated machinery, fitted pipes, and ran electrical wire to build massive ships.\n\nThe Charlestown Navy Yard played a significant role in transforming the Navy from sail to steam.

Iron bars replaced the simple wooden fence in 1847, and in 1901 Gate 1 was reconstructed as a granite and brick gatehouse in the Beaux-Arts style. This castle-like structure was used by Marines not only as a gatehouse but also as living quarters.\nAfter World War II, gate usage shifted again. Increasing automobile traffic ultimately led to the demolition of the ornate gatehouse in the 1950s. This new Gate 1, which still greets visitors to the yard today, allowed for two-way traffic and featured 1950s architecture that incorporated a greater use of steel and glass. While somewhat mismatched to the older buildings and architectural styles, Gate 1 represents the Yard as a space in a constant state of change, one that is required to both uphold tradition and meet practical requirements.","assetId":"7C9B1B42-70CF-4467-BBBA-D541ED562F21","assetName":"Gate 1","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"552FAE64-A8B2-97E9-CAB5608EB510D92A","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"If you visit the Charlestown Navy Yard today, you might notice railroad tracks crisscrossing the ground. While many sections are gone—either torn up or paved over—the surviving pieces echo what used to be a busy network of tracks throughout the Navy Yard. On that rail network, small trains once trundled from building to building and out to the dry docks and piers.\nCompared to wagons pulled by horses and oxen, the introduction of the railroad in the 1860s allowed the Yard to transport heavy and bulky materials more effectively. Further, a rail connection to nearby railroads meant the Charlestown Navy Yard was not only interconnected, but it was also directly accessible to places far beyond its gates.\nIn the 1950s, however, the US Navy’s use of the rails sharply declined. Larger and more powerful trucks, capable of driving anywhere, replaced many roles of the railroad.

This included the construction of the first American dry docks. A dry dock is a large basin attached to a body of water. When full with water, the basin can be opened and a ship can be maneuvered inside. Shipyard workers then close the dry dock and drain the water, leaving the ship resting on keel blocks.\nFor the Yard, Civil Engineer Loammi Baldwin designed a revolutionary dry dock that used steam engines to power the pumps that drained the basin. The Boston dry dock opened on June 24, 1833 for repair work on the USS CONSTITUTION. To accommodate larger ships, Dry Dock 1 has been extended a couple times. After a final extension in 1947, Dry Dock 1 measured 404-feet in length, the same length it remains today.\nWhen the Yard closed in 1974, Dry Dock 1 remained one of its few operational assets.

Building 10, on the other hand, represents a different type of structure at the Yard: one built to fill multiple, evolving roles as the needs of the US Navy changed.\nCompleted in 1853, Building 10 initially served the yard's caulkers, who used tarred rope fibers to make the hulls of wooden ships watertight. However, with the shift from wooden to iron-hulled ships in the 1890s, the Navy repurposed Building 10 to be a paint shop. In 1906, when the workload of the shop outgrew the building, its function changed again. \nOver the following years Building 10 served as a storeroom, office space, radio station, and a laundry. In 1948, it became a sonar facility and by the 1960s, Building 10 had become a battery charging station. From 1972 - 1973 and after serving multiple roles since its original construction, Building 10 became the USS Constitution Museum, before the Museum moved to its current location.","assetId":"0BBB00A9-4887-4D7D-987C-71573CB04BEE","assetName":"Building 10","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"55A781B7-0B52-7334-F8393B9711401665","ordinal":"5","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"From underneath, it is easy to see why the two large cranes still found at the Charlestown Navy Yard—Crane 62 and Crane 65—are called \"portal cranes.\" The open space, or portal, between the metal legs allowed workers and machines to move through the crane rather than having to go around. Conversely, operators could move the cranes along railroad tracks, driving them over blockages and repositioning them where needed.\nThe combination of its open portal, revolving top, and ability to move made the portal crane remarkably flexible and well-suited to its work at the Navy Yard. These cranes played a pivotal role in the building and repairing of ships at the Yard starting from their introduction in the 1940s until the Yard’s closure in 1974. When the Yard closed in 1974, many of the cranes were scrapped or moved. However, since the Charlestown Navy Yard remained the home of USS CONSTITUTION, these two portal cranes have remained alongside Dry Dock 1 to assist with maintaining the ship.","assetId":"3FFEC624-A03A-460B-82FE-6BA86D835DC1","assetName":"Portal Crane","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"897DF2C7-F4E9-C387-2DD4141EF1BDBB44","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Set upon the highest point in the Charlestown Navy Yard, the Commandant's House stands apart from the cranes, shipways, railways, and industrial buildings that define the Yard's landscape.

He directed the Yard as a military and industrial center while also welcoming important guests. As such, he needed a home that fit those needs. Completed in 1805, the Commandant's House reflected the Commandant's importance and expectation as a host. The house was divided into two worlds. Upstairs, the house was a private living space for the Commandant and his family. Downstairs, it was a public ceremonial space for dances, formal luncheons, dinners, and other gatherings.

It served as home for the “Leathernecks” for 163 years, expanding as necessary to fit the needs of the Marines stationed at the Yard. The Barracks included not only housing, but also a barbershop, post exchange, chaplain’s office, movie theater, brig, and pistol range. \nAt the Yard, Marines controlled access to the Yard, guarded the naval prison, and deployed as required to conflicts around the world. The Marines even responded to civil emergencies throughout Boston, including prison riots, crowd control, and fire relief.\nThe Marines lowered the Yard’s American Flag for the last time on July 1, 1974, when the Yard closed.

Initially steam-powered, the facility made use of a number of innovations designed by local inventor Daniel Treadwell. Its sturdy granite and brick construction was also notable as an early attempt at fireproofing. The Charlestown Navy Yard Ropewalk became the Navy’s biggest ropemaking facility. Even after the transition from sail to steam in the later half of the 1800s, ships still required miles of rope. A World War II battleship needed 34,000 feet of cordage and the Charlestown Navy Yard rapidly increased production after Pearl Harbor to its highest levels during World War II. While the US government considered closing the Ropewalk after the war, its role in rope testing and developing new types of rope likely kept it operation until 1970.","assetId":"4C3F1B99-3158-481A-84B9-59BD784D3357","assetName":"Ropewalk","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"55AF0B4C-A5E2-BA33-4AE0FAF77C20FA72","ordinal":"9","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Completed in 1904, Building 105 was not the first metal working shop at the Charlestown Navy Yard. By the 1880s, the Yard had already established itself as the primary manufacturer of anchors and anchor chain for the US Navy. This new building was designed to keep pace with the radically increasing size and number of Navy ships during the 1900s. Despite its size, Building 105's output remained limited because the chain-making process of the era proved very slow. Anchor chain was made from wrought iron and involved welding each link by hand. During World War I, the rapid expansion of the Navy required the development of a new chain-making process. With the chain forge facing obsolescence in the 1920s, workers developed a new type of chain using the drop hammers and forging equipment already in Building 105. The resulting steel “die-lock” links were much stronger and faster to produce than wrought iron chain. The forge in Charlestown remains the only place in the world that has made a 4 ¾ inch die-lock chain.","assetId":"3A5FBE13-61CB-4A54-BA63-1E676F1B8865","assetName":"Chain Forge, Building 105","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"89B4CCD7-AA61-3D87-9EFD5ECCBCEA1ABD","ordinal":"10","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Charlestown Navy Yard Tour","topics":[{"id":"69693007-2DF2-4EDE-BB3B-A25EBA72BDF5","name":"Architecture and Building"},{"id":"FE005582-12C5-472C-8229-3CB004DB050E","name":"Engineering"},{"id":"0B575E33-B68F-4F3D-998E-B03284606CF3","name":"Industry"},{"id":"AAF8795A-231B-4DA4-B564-AA51C95E72BD","name":"Factories"},{"id":"14FA9FF3-7D86-4406-9A6D-BE9032A1C578","name":"Laborer and Worker"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"7A9F5EB5-4AE3-4A16-AFF0-E1F9FF2F8B32","name":"US Navy"},{"id":"64808223-DD03-40ED-99A1-76183E7AB1F5","name":"US Marines"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"F94E78D3-EC70-4B99-AB57-BC70C4E79D65","name":"War of 1812"},{"id":"4EC51024-F0D9-479D-AF3F-344CC0153D2E","name":"World War I"},{"id":"74869FAE-8DFD-4454-847F-11FDDB679F94","name":"World War II"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"}],"description":"Enjoy the springtime tradition of hanami (花見) or flower-viewing and enjoy the sights of the Tidal Basin and beyond.

These passes allowed the paroled Confederates to secure free passage on board Federal trains and steamships, and they also permitted Lee’s men to draw rations from any Federal forces they encountered on the way home.\n\n On April 10, Federal soldiers set up printing presses in the Clover Hill Tavern and General George Sharpe oversaw the printing of approximately 30,000 passes in the span of about 30 hours.

Lee refused this request, stating that the fates of the remaining Confederate armies would be up to Jefferson Davis and the other Confederate generals to decide. With armies remaining in the field, Lee asked if something could be provided to his men to ensure them safe passage home through Federal and Confederate lines, and Grant agreed to print parole passes for the Confederate troops.","assetId":"83697A84-D78C-4A30-9782-C35B51282B72","assetName":"Lee and Grant Second Meeting Site","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"7C0E046A-9E07-9AB5-771BC3C73314ACAA","ordinal":"8","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The formal surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia spanned three days.

At the outbreak of the conflict, widow Elizabeth Kelley lived in this home. By the fall of 1862, all five of Kelley’s sons had enlisted in the Confederate Army. Two sons died of disease, but the others survived the war. One son remained with the Army of Northern Virginia in April of 1865 and was present at the surrender. For many White, Southern families like the Kelleys, Lee’s surrender marked a bitter conclusion to the war.\n\nIn 1871, John Robinson purchased the home. As a formally enslaved man, Robinson had been trained as a cobbler. He applied his skills by operating his own shoemaking business out of this house. Robinson’s trade skills likely provided him with greater opportunities than those available to formerly enslaved people without a trade skill.

He was the victorious 5-star general who oversaw the Allied victory in Europe during World War II. Ike and his wife Mamie purchased the property for $44,000, dreaming of a peaceful and tranquil retirement.  \n\nSoon after buying the farm, Eisenhower became the Supreme Commander of NATO forces.

Over his two terms, this home would be a central part of the Eisenhowers' lives.\n\nFinally, in 1961, 11 years after buying their farm, the Eisenhowers left the White House and, at long last, had their retirement home of their dreams.","assetId":"75D35D6E-A952-445B-A708-D87FD0F83F30","assetName":"Eisenhower Home","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"980BC4AD-EE17-E696-90F833C4BC9BD41F","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"A beautiful and scenic pathway, the tree lined allee was the main entrance to the property, providing privacy and serenity for the Eisenhowers and their guests.","assetId":"C7E63DC8-89C9-4DD0-BA89-5BD67E3545AE","assetName":"The Entry Drive Allee","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"97F23729-0C88-E71F-4C5EA90A80B16FE2","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"This former milk house was used as an office space by agents of the United States Secret Service during Eisenhower’s presidency and retirement. ","assetId":"16713515-0B99-4303-81E7-E7CDB9638A2E","assetName":"Secret Service Office","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"97F50624-B081-FD49-7F8BDCD7AD6AD0D4","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"This building was originally used as a storage and garage area.

Schools and scouting groups continue the tradition of helping the park today.","assetId":"72DAA657-C333-44F0-A61D-789FCD43B017","assetName":"Brown's Farm Trail Stop 6: The Pine Grove","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/6498D39B-E381-8B4F-9148B2A09899076E.mp3","id":"60E29478-D070-D8D1-00352A27631FAB28","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The Brown Family's farmhouse was built of chestnut logs that once stood on this stone foundation.

This political atmosphere in Congress Hall made some question the wisdom of allowing \"the People\" a role in government.","assetId":"E764695B-8E1B-43B6-8302-693928573899","assetName":"Congress Hall","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/16222523-0FBA-B03D-A698329ECB0963F1.mp3","id":"169AC833-F7B0-0B51-5E0DA01EE43EDE50","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Next to the Franklin Court Printing Office stood the newspaper office of Benjamin Franklin Bache’s Philadelphia Aurora, a newspaper published in Philadelphia in the 1790s. Newspapers played an active role in the political life of the early Republic. Bache, grandson to Benjamin Franklin and a Democratic Republican, believed that the voice of the people was being ignored by the government. Angry editorials in the Aurora claimed that the Federalist Party would, “overthrow the constitution…or establish a monarchy if they could…” Federalist newspapers claimed that men like Bache threatened the “peace and safety of this country.” Criticisms of the John Adams administration brought retribution to Bache. At times Bache was physically assaulted by political opponents, and in 1798 he faced imprisonment for sedition for publishing articles critical of the government. Though Bache would die of yellow fever while awaiting trial, his arrest sparked a debate over what freedom of the press and government of the people meant.","assetId":"A7DA6815-FBFE-43B3-84E7-3BF7AD8343C7","assetName":"Franklin Court Printing Office","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/16D221D0-9646-4CA6-3A2906910BC54085.mp3","id":"1742D435-BED7-6403-9947A8BEAD0B8BC7","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Robert Morris’ residence was rented by Presidents George Washington and John Adams. Washington and Adams both lived and worked out of their home. They held cabinet meetings, met with foreign dignitaries, and hosted state dinners.  The Constitution’s framers believed that “the People” alone could not be trusted to govern. As part of the balance of power, the Constitution included a powerful executive. The president would be selected by an Electoral College, be given the power to veto laws made by the people’s representatives, and uphold laws deemed unpopular by “the People,” even by force if necessary. This was made evident when Washington called out state militias and led them into western Pennsylvania to put down the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.

It was the story of how the “Old State House Bell,” hanging in the steeple of Independence Hall, had fulfilled the words inscribed on its crown, “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants Thereof,” when it rang in the Declaration of Independence in 1776. This document stated that, “All men are created equal,” and that these “men” had the “unalienable” right of having a say in their government. Soon after, abolitionists recognizing that these rights did not apply to all, adopted this Bell as a symbol in their struggle to make enslaved men a part of “We the People,” and renamed it the Liberty Bell. Later, women seeking the right to vote would also adopt it as symbol for their struggle.  Since then countless groups have used this Bell as their symbol including Civil rights activists and white supremacists; cold warriors and anti-war protestors; gun rights and gun control advocates… Who do you see adopting this Bell as a symbol of freedom today?","assetId":"283C3731-55CE-4C73-88CE-B48B03981E9D","assetName":"Liberty Bell Center","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/176C0468-EF83-9BC4-108EC42FE7526D9D.mp3","id":"1772D6D2-9C92-4737-FCB44C9B4E146A17","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Founding of a Republic, 1776 - 1800","topics":[{"id":"F3883A66-A7CB-461B-868E-1B5932224B25","name":"American Revolution"},{"id":"F669BC40-BDC4-41C0-9ACE-B2CD25373045","name":"Presidents"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"990E22A2-20D8-4CC2-8E6C-D2DF165BCDA5","name":"American Revolutionary War"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"},{"id":"BFF8C027-7C8F-480B-A5F8-CD8CE490BFBA","name":"Hiking"},{"id":"45261C0A-00D8-4C27-A1F8-029F933A0D34","name":"Front-Country Hiking"},{"id":"DF4A35E0-7983-4A3E-BC47-F37B872B0F25","name":"Junior Ranger Program"},{"id":"0B685688-3405-4E2A-ABBA-E3069492EC50","name":"Wildlife Watching"}],"description":"Along this self-guided tour you will see various hydrothermal features that are expressions of Yellowstone's still active volcano.

The engineers had only managed to build the bridge halfway across the river when shots rang out and the Battle of Fredericksburg began.","assetId":"C3E05A83-EF5B-4391-80DF-42A68B1E7B4F","assetName":"Chatham Entrance","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/7AAB01D8-E1BD-0C00-B30DAE711AF9D5C3.mp3","id":"BA5E9A80-A54B-C650-57130B3D47C7D940","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"On the western side of Fredericksburg, atop a hill once known as Telegraph Hill, Confederate General Robert E. Lee made his headquarters in anticipation of battle. Initially, Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia were situated further south. As reports came in that the United States Army was amassing at Fredericksburg, Lee moved his army into position surrounding the town.\n\nWhen Burnside and the Army of the Potomac arrived at Chatham, Lee was unsure of the Federals' plan. Where would Burnside cross the Rappahannock: right there at town, further upstream, further downstream? Lee was not prepared to face the larger US Army of 120,000 men because he had divided his forces,  with Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley and Longstreet in Culpeper.\n\nFrom this hill, Lee was able to see both ends of his line: the north end above the stone wall and the south end on Prospect Hill. His vantage point gave him the opportunity to know what was happening and adapt if necessary.","assetId":"39C646B3-8592-41E5-898D-BEF7E3FC2417","assetName":"Lee's Hill (Telegraph Hill)","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/7BD5C7D4-0CAE-E20C-D6D65107BC9A599E.mp3","id":"BA634FCA-C9B1-574F-5DC0434B4302CBF7","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Howison Hill, named for the Howison family that lived nearby, was an artillery position during the battle of Fredericksburg. In this area, Jane Howison Beale and her family watched the battle of Fredericksburg and she recorded her observations, thoughts, and feelings about the scene.\n\nLee utilized the high hills west of Fredericksburg for his defenses, giving his artillery clear views of the oncoming Federal troops.

En la década de 1890, el ejército reemplazó un muelle de madera ampliado con un sistema de rieles, a fin de desplazar dentro y fuera del muelle las minas submarinas y sus materiales respectivos.\n\nConstruido en 1906, el Centro de visitantes sirvió originalmente como almacén para las minas submarinas, las cuales desempeñaron un papel fundamental en la defensa del puerto de Boston. Las minas se colocaron en puntos y profundidades predeterminados del puerto, y estaban conectadas al fuerte a través de un sistema de cableado eléctrico. Durante las dos guerras mundiales, los operadores vigilantes dentro del fuerte estaban listos para detonar las minas en caso de un ataque por parte de las fuerzas alemanas.","assetId":"09D5E6B0-14D2-4478-99B3-7504346D6678","assetName":"Visitor Center \u0026 Dock","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/18381821-E6A1-F00B-5B933FA87466505F.mp3","id":"E03FF1FA-0E9A-DC69-C88BB3D5FB26CD41","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Demi-Lune (Media Luna) y Defensas externas\nLa cubierta sirvió como una línea de defensa inicial y protegió las murallas de granito de Fort Warren del fuego directo de los cañones enemigos, bien fuera desde un barco de costados anchos o desde una isla cercana invadida.

They lived on a vast glacial plain which once extended across what is now the lower portion of the bay.  Imagine that, where today you see water, there once was land. That land was sandwiched between the sea and a large glacier. During the Little Ice Ages, temperatures cooled and that glacier moved forward. The land on which the Tlingit lived was overrun and the people were forced to flee. They left in canoes very similar to the one you see in front of you. This canoe provides us a clue about the age of these forests. It was carved from the trunk of a Sitka spruce tree, the same species you can see growing on the hillside behind it.","assetId":"E05BA308-E9BD-4080-85F6-FCB44D2A1528","assetName":"Sea Otter Canoe, Yáxwch'i Yaakw","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"DB9FBDFE-ADC9-E2C0-431C9DB0E96FF18B","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The Bartlett Cove around us today is very different from the way this area looked 250 years ago. Back then there was no bay! A giant ice sheet blanketed the region.  Since that time, the ice has receded. Seawater flooded the areas below sea level, creating the bay as we know it. Life has and continues to return to this landscape. By examining the land we can learn much about change and recovery.

The glacier that overran the Tlingit Homeland eventually receded. As it did so, a great weight was removed from the Earth's crust and as a result the land began rising in much the same way the surface of a cushion rises after you’ve been sitting on it. This is called isostatic rebound or post-glacial rebound. Today, the land in Glacier Bay is rising at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year -- faster than anywhere else on the planet. Notice the U.S.G.S. benchmark on top of this rock. It was placed here in 1966. Today it sits about five feet higher than it did then. Also, if you look across the cove, you’ll notice a point which juts out into the bay. From this angle, it’s evident that the trees are shorter closer to the shoreline. That’s because they’re younger, growing on land that only recently emerged from the sea.","assetId":"CB2E5FA2-8176-4E38-B225-333BE28A7964","assetName":"USGS Bartlett Cove Coast Marker","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"DBAE48F0-BA01-1E1E-3E27D3E9C20FEFEA","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Take a close look at the beach rocks and you'll notice they have lichen growing on them. In the classic story of plant succession, lichen spores carried on the wind are among the first life forms to return to the barren landscape after the glacier ice melts away. Landing on rocks, the lichen spores anchored themselves to the rock, and began to break down the rock surface making it possible for mosses to find purchase. Moss further breaks down the rock into soil making it possible for flowering plants and trees to move in. Alder helps put nitrogen into the soil making it possible for bigger trees to grow, like quick growing willows and cottonwoods. Later, spruce seeds germinate in the alder-leaf litter and, once they emerge into sunlight, they also grow rapidly. The spruce trees grow to great heights and will eventually crowd out the other trees. This process of each organism preparing the land for the one that follows is called succession. However, it is not always as systematic as that.","assetId":"CDC2DC50-852E-4D67-862A-5DD80EFD8A1F","assetName":"Bartlett Cove Beach Rocks","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"DBBABD92-AD7E-829E-50DD3BB80822FB86","ordinal":"5","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Smaller, weaker trees with shallow root systems are especially susceptible to wind gusts. But they may help other trees survive by becoming \"nurse logs”, which play an important role in forest ecology. On the forest floor, the dense cover of ferns can impede the growth of new trees. Downed trees can provide an excellent perch for seedlings to take root. Also, by falling the dead tree opens up space in the forest canopy allowing light to reach the forest floor. As the logs decay, their accumulated nutrients become available to young trees and moss that also grows on the log helps retain water. Eventually nurse logs will rot away altogether, but by then the younger trees growing out of them may have extended their roots into the soil so they can survive on their own. In some places you will find rows of trees growing around seemingly hollow spaces where nurse logs once existed.","assetId":"8D80390D-D9F7-4FD9-A324-83E74A190276","assetName":"Nurse Log in Bartlett Cove","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"DBC7DFB8-FB71-E74A-6CB36F827ECB9BDB","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"By now you may have noticed that Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) have singular dark green needles that are square and sharp to the touch.

The relationship between these two trees and their presence in this forest is like that old story of the tortoise and the hare. Spruce grow quickly and need considerable sunshine. Hemlock grow slowly, but are shade tolerant. Though it seems like there are more spruce present right now, hemlocks might be slowly catching up and may eventually dominate.

It is possible that this pond is in the process of changing into \"muskeg,\" which is a spongy, wet bog. As muskeg is highly acidic, it is difficult for things to grow.

Ultimately, the protests were heeded and a dam was instead built at Flaming Gorge, 70 miles (113 Kilometers) upstream on the Green River from here.","assetId":"2ADDBEF2-43AA-41EE-A9AB-CC1AA8D59543","assetName":"Harpers Corner Trail Stop 16","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/B4F1B068-06FC-89C6-2FAD1E19096B9E06.mp3","id":"B4FACB73-C829-5851-64ABB3F9E631F88F","ordinal":"17","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Harpers Corner Trail: Tour of the Canyons","topics":[{"id":"0D00073E-18C3-46E5-8727-2F87B112DDC6","name":"Animals"},{"id":"957EF2BD-AC6C-4B7B-BD9A-87593ADC6691","name":"Birds"},{"id":"BCE3ACBE-7871-495B-AEA3-5E19BC482405","name":"Canyons and Canyonlands"},{"id":"F0F97E32-2F29-41B4-AF98-9FBE8DAB36B1","name":"Geology"},{"id":"A155238F-0DD2-4610-9B87-05FCE1C59283","name":"River and Riparian"},{"id":"4244F489-6813-4B7A-9D0C-20CE098C8FFF","name":"Rock Landscapes and Features"},{"id":"9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B","name":"Scenic Views"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"BFF8C027-7C8F-480B-A5F8-CD8CE490BFBA","name":"Hiking"},{"id":"45261C0A-00D8-4C27-A1F8-029F933A0D34","name":"Front-Country Hiking"},{"id":"587BB2D3-EC35-41B2-B3F7-A39E2B088AEE","name":"Swimming"},{"id":"C2801992-F34D-4974-A0F2-80FF04309EE4","name":"Saltwater Swimming"},{"id":"0C0D142F-06B5-4BE1-8B44-491B90F93DEB","name":"Park Film"},{"id":"C8F98B28-3C10-41AE-AA99-092B3B398C43","name":"Museum Exhibits"}],"description":"Tour the historic Hatteras Light Station, home to the famous Cape Hatteras Lighthouse.","durationMax":"2","durationMin":"1","durationUnit":"h","id":"5B71B98C-D266-1FCB-97F559060C6B1FE3","images":[{"altText":"White Building in a green grassy field","caption":"","credit":"","crops":[{"aspectRatio":1.78,"url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/primary/8717F778-075F-4F05-DD0889469E0FCE18.jpg"},{"aspectRatio":1,"url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/secondary/8717F778-075F-4F05-DD0889469E0FCE18.jpg"}],"title":"Museum of the Sea","url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/8717F778-075F-4F05-DD0889469E0FCE18.jpg"}],"park":{"states":"NC","designation":"National Seashore","parkCode":"caha","fullName":"Cape Hatteras National Seashore","url":"https://www.nps.gov/caha/index.htm","name":"Cape Hatteras"},"relevanceScore":1,"stops":[{"significance":"Visitor Center for Hatteras Light Station","assetId":"4C12328D-FC42-4876-B2E6-B8BF57F33B77","assetName":"Hatteras Island Visitor Center","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/85EDE875-A18B-F576-00727D3F81CE364F.mp3","id":"5BD0BAD7-CA90-7F9E-A3BFED60227DF824","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Shaded pavilion with great views of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse","assetId":"A4D1779D-8BBE-4F17-BC3A-D8B49F780D9D","assetName":"Program Pavilion","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/85FA2ACE-E00F-9579-7C15078BE06C7EF4.mp3","id":"5C0D1594-DBC4-7E98-324718B09DB66C15","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Tallest brick lighthouse in North America at 197.5 feet tall.","assetId":"95E085BB-DC90-4545-88B3-EB9FC29F07B4","assetName":"Cape Hatteras Light Station","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/8605F554-0144-9316-128055AA6CE33B24.mp3","id":"84AD38B7-EDA0-8F57-CF6CABD7745A83E5","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Residence of the keepers of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse.","assetId":"E8690EBD-A00A-4D26-96B8-9E1402CBF2B2","assetName":"Hatteras Principal Keeper's Quarters","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/860C5BA4-AEEC-1396-77A81068493DDB29.mp3","id":"857A6730-B32A-4D2E-69898B53FAB2946D","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Duplex for additional lighthouse keepers to live on site.","assetId":"335266BB-BDDC-4CC5-9FCF-085AAC07B34E","assetName":"Museum of the Sea","assetType":"visitorcenters","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/86152595-9FA7-6703-D9B9073EF4C2EF05.mp3","id":"5CFF4D9D-A4C1-28E1-410F3FBCE2637984","ordinal":"5","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Original foundation stones of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, etched with the name of all the lighthouse keepers.","assetId":"EC3F2413-D9A3-4992-BA28-4A8DC1B1050D","assetName":"Keepers of the Light Amphitheater","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/8623785E-B90A-DCA7-58D3EFAD4064A64D.mp3","id":"5C1EC457-A63C-BFFE-690F9FC799FAF934","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Original site of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse","assetId":"B355325B-18F4-461C-8ED4-721D3A7149CC","assetName":"Historic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Site","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/86543663-A52F-ABD4-251C538D32DB3392.mp3","id":"5D378C4A-BCA9-44AD-9063C9CA8086526B","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Beach access point.

The most profitable market for their goods were in the more populated areas of cities and towns.

Corn and rye were very bulky to transport but when converted to whiskey, they became more profitable.\n\nWhile the average horse was capable of hauling only 4 bushels of corn at a time, the same horse could haul the equivalent of 24 bushels if the grain was manufactured into whiskey. The liquid whiskey occupied less space and was easier to carry to market. The price of whiskey depended on a number of other factors, as well. The better the grade of corn, the better the whiskey. The more plentiful the spring water happened to be, the better the whiskey produced with it.

The furnace would run for over 100 years on charcoal fuel before switching to coal in 1873.","assetId":"7F0E4C3A-F064-42FE-A491-DC54BB7E398E","assetName":"Charcoal Exhibit Trail: Fueling the Furnace","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/F9FD53C9-C2B9-314D-08DC6B37EC22DA6D.mp3","id":"D114E741-DEF2-BF39-20CA84F44083938B","ordinal":"7","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Industry on the Mountain: Charcoal Exhibit Trail","topics":[]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"}],"description":"This tour takes you through the Castillo's interior rooms and gundeck.

Construction of the Castillo de San Marcos began in 1672, making it one of the oldest standing structures in North America. The fort has undergone many renovations and changes over the years but appears today much as it would have looked at its final completion in 1756.\n \nThe Castillo was initially built by the Spanish to protect their vast empire in the Americas. Engineer Ignacio Daza designed a fortress using a bastion system. The star-like outline of the Castillo is formed by diamond shaped projections, called bastions, located on each corner of the fort. The design eliminates blind spots for the guards in the garitas,or sentry boxes, at each bastion point and increases the fort's firepower by allowing multiple cannons to fire on the same target creating a crossfire effect.","assetId":"DB530307-2C38-475C-AC51-03500258F371","assetName":"Florida: Castillo de San Marcos National

The dam’s greatest affect is not the river’s color, but its flow. After its completion in 1969, the great spring floods of former years are now trapped behind the dam. This altered the habitat downstream and made it more difficult for native fish to survive.

Hudson's Bay Company traders first came to San Juan to purchase excess fish from the Tribes who lived and thrived here for generations. \n\n In the late 19th century, enhanced canning technology attracted big business to the Salmon Bank.

Their extreme efficiency made independent fishing less profitable, and corporations took much of the harvest that Coast Salish and independent Euro-American fishers once caught. \n\n \n\nNonetheless, corporate fisheries provided opportunities for local people. Their canneries purchased the fish caught by independent fishing entrepreneurs like Henry Cayou, hired local men and women to work in their salmon operations, and purchased supplies from local farmers.\n\nThe fishing industry's extreme efficiency decimated the salmon stocks.

Their salmon consumption is so immense that scientists believe that killer whales consume more salmon than seals, sea lions, and commercial fisheries. While salmon populations have increased moderately in the past 50 years, the health of Southern Residents is a major factor that regulates the legal limit for salmon fishing in our island.","assetId":"4DB2B18A-7A19-4EA9-B4BB-A168745A05B7","assetName":"The Whale Museum","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"E5807FDB-F654-9184-242CB1E6CA490036","ordinal":"6","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"San Juan Island Salmon Tour","topics":[{"id":"0B575E33-B68F-4F3D-998E-B03284606CF3","name":"Industry"},{"id":"14FA9FF3-7D86-4406-9A6D-BE9032A1C578","name":"Laborer and Worker"},{"id":"4C9D4777-A9DA-47D1-A0B9-F4A3C98BC1B3","name":"Maritime"},{"id":"69E16062-0E4F-4DE0-91FB-E4EDB2484572","name":"Migrations"},{"id":"0D00073E-18C3-46E5-8727-2F87B112DDC6","name":"Animals"},{"id":"0E6D8503-CB65-467F-BCD6-C6D9E28A4E0B","name":"Oceans"},{"id":"980D1693-65BF-4F29-8182-7BAC9796E605","name":"Whales"},{"id":"9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B","name":"Scenic Views"},{"id":"78E4F4AC-AF97-435A-8C2C-7FB8D67516ED","name":"Unique Species"},{"id":"489D6333-FD72-44DF-83B0-3D4412DD0A75","name":"Endangered"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"}],"description":"This tour provides 5 interpretive stops along the 1.5 mile hike (one-way) to the ranger station.

the oldest capital city in the US, founded in 1610, and the highest US capital at 7,000 feet.

Ricketts. \n\nThe grounds of Portici served as the site of the 1861-1862 winter encampment for a brigade of Alabamians and Virginians commanded by General Cadmus Wilcox.  \n\nSome of the last fighting at Second Manassas occured on these fields on 30 August 1862 when Confederate cavalry, on a mission to cut off the Union army's line of retreat, were stopped by Union cavalry.  \n\nFrom the parking lot, take the mowed trail up to the Portici House site and the scene of the 1862 cavalry engagement.","assetId":"D3698BEA-E209-430D-B8A8-BAA3F42E553E","assetName":"Auto Tour Stop #11: Portici","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"41E935AA-C772-F45D-91849C10F809E6E7","ordinal":"12","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The Fauquier and Alexandria Turnpike bridge over Bull Run, known simply as \"the Stone Bridge,\" was originally built in 1825. Its ability to carry traffic across the steep sided stream even at times of high water gave the Stone Bridge a key role during the Civil War.\n\nFollowing the defeat at Second Manassas, Union forces used the bridge as their primary line of retreat. In the early hours of August 31, as the last Union soldiers crossed it, the bridge was destroyed.  The current bridge was built in the mid-1880s with traffic diverted to a secondary bridge in the mid-1920s. \n\nFrom the parking lot, a 1.3 mile loop trail provides picturesque views of Bull Run and displays of wildflowers, including bluebells, in the spring and colorful foliage in the fall. This trail winds its way up to the heights above Bull Run. Along the way, you will pass interpretive panels at points of importance at First Manassas.","assetId":"AA533DD9-9976-4D21-AE47-0C050409EEE2","assetName":"Auto Tour Stop #12: Stone Bridge","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"41EC1BA7-9ECE-7D6D-BAFC4858E1C30B34","ordinal":"13","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Second Manassas Driving Tour","topics":[{"id":"D9FC6D14-F8C7-4EBA-86EA-DFD99B6BB4F5","name":"Enslavement"},{"id":"1F833C99-A75D-4F9E-9256-B96523485466","name":"Farming and  Agriculture"},{"id":"F67CA03D-109F-44B9-9B63-D9EC9FD77A1D","name":"Plantations"},{"id":"4B3CD083-7500-434B-A8C2-D355925E0245","name":"Medicine"},{"id":"97716EF5-D001-449C-993A-EC15AB8FD345","name":"Hospital"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"E411F474-A530-4804-9D23-1D94C78B41E4","name":"Infantry and Militia"},{"id":"B145FAB8-5462-4FE2-964E-464D3A5E7F96","name":"Artillery"},{"id":"69790851-A62A-4920-AA3E-E61406FFC27D","name":"Cavalry"},{"id":"97CCB419-196C-4B95-BB3A-621458F78415","name":"US Army"},{"id":"6A3658B4-FB6E-4E23-A63A-9AEF11988831","name":"Battlefields"},{"id":"BEB7E470-13B2-4E00-84B2-0402D98DAF69","name":"Monuments and Memorials"},{"id":"518B32FB-339D-4C52-B2C2-04BF406AA4B0","name":"Religion and Spirituality"},{"id":"98F41FDF-B73F-4B68-8010-53CCB2891E3B","name":"Churches"},{"id":"FE2C2613-B41E-4531-BC43-03EB6E45CBCF","name":"Transportation"},{"id":"1015393C-D7B0-47F3-86FB-786F30368CA2","name":"Bridges"},{"id":"0BBD4A42-2B3D-4E82-B5C4-1A3874C8682E","name":"Roads, Routes and Highways"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"A8E54356-20CD-490E-B34D-AC6A430E6F47","name":"Civil War"},{"id":"9C9FCBB6-360B-4743-8155-6F9341CBE01B","name":"Scenic Views"},{"id":"5BE55D7F-BDB6-4E3D-AC35-2D8EBB974417","name":"Trails"}]},{"activities":[],"description":"See the fort on your own using this audio tour.

Stoneman wanted to take Macon and free Union prisoners held at Camp Oglethorpe in Macon. When Stoneman couldn’t take Macon by storm, he began lobbing shells into the city. That afternoon General Stoneman retreated from Macon, but the Rebels captured Stoneman at Sunshine Church north of Macon and sent his troops to the prison camp at Andersonville. The Confederates constructed the U-shape earthworks here to protect the Walnut Creek railroad trestle from future attacks.  \n\nFighting took place here again in November 1864 at the Battle of Walnut Creek, when Union Calvary was sent to divert attention from General Sherman’s March to the Sea through Georgia.

The Lodge was a ceremonial council chamber, and the clay floor dates to 1015 C.E. Across from the entrance is a bird effigy platform. The three seats atop it were likely reserved for the chief, second chief, and the public speaker. 47 seats descend in height as they move away from the platform, suggesting a seating hierarchy. Each seat has a small oval depression in front of it, which may have been used to present ceremonial objects. The firepit in the center was likely used for ceremonies.\n\nThe Lodge was burned in the late 13th century; perhaps as a ritual for renewal or purification, or possibly because the building had deteriorated too much for any further use. Either way, as the roof caved in, it buried and preserved the clay floor for 800 years until it was rediscovered in 1934. To preserve and protect the prehistoric floor, reconstruction of the Earth Lodge began in 1936 and was completed in 1938 by the CCC and WPA.","assetId":"9293DE91-48F9-46B6-AA39-3BC30DC58FC9","assetName":"Earth Lodge","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"C369CA52-C020-B65F-BB4433554F701B6B","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The Cornfield Mound dates to the Mississippian period. The Mississippians were master farmers who grew corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, and tobacco. When archaeologists excavated this mound in the 1930s, they discovered cultivated rows and a charred corncob, leading them to believe that the Mississippians used the area as a cornfield before building the mound over it. The Mississippians farmed most of their crops near the Ocmulgee River, while this cornfield was likely used for ceremonies since it's near the Earth Lodge. Look at the prehistoric trenches on the right-side of the Cornfield mound with the Earth Lodge behind you. These trenches were partially excavated and left unfilled. The trenches are between 3 to 9 feet deep and 15 to 25 feet wide. The parallel trenches remain in sections as a series of oval depressions in semicircular bands. The purpose of these trenches is unknown; they may have been for irrigation or as a defensive barrier, but most likely they were borrow pits for building the mounds.","assetId":"C72B5014-FDB0-4CFD-9ECC-0557B9CA4F8F","assetName":"Cornfield Mound","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"C3A78D87-0044-D88C-6A32A227A51B938F","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"While the trading post is no more, the wooden beams here outline where it was established in 1690 C.E. by Charleston traders. The British competed with the Spanish operating in the area. The Indians preferred British trade items over Spanish because British goods were superior, their trading prices lower, and their demands on Indian culture were less. Indians traded deerskins for guns, beads, bells, and other European goods until around 1715, when the Indians were unable to produce enough deerskins to compensate for the European goods. Some traders, reacting to the London-based capitalist demands for payment, sold Indian women and children into slavery in the Caribbean. This led to the Yamasee War. The colonists defeated the Indian uprising in 1717, but by then the trading post here had been burned and abandoned. \n\nThe site was excavated in 1935-36.

It was where the Mississippian village leaders were buried. The mound was built in seven stages with structures on top of each level, which were probably used to prepare the dead for burial and the accompanying ceremonies. Massive log tombs were contained in its lowest level and over a hundred burials were placed throughout the mound with elaborate copper and shell ornaments that suggest high-status burials. The 1870s railroad construction bisected the mound and left only the southern portion intact. Archaeologists later excavated this section in December of 1933. The mound’s current height is at the third level of the mound and is 20 feet high. When the mound had the seventh and final level during the Mississippian period, it would have been 280 feet long, 100 feet wide, and 25 feet high.

Imagine the organization and diligence required by the entire village to accomplish such a feat. The mounds were used by the elite of the society of building their houses and temples on top of them. The GTM was most likely where the Mississippian chief lived, while the Lesser Temple Mound (LTM) may have been where the second chief lived. \n\nThe LTM was partially destroyed by railroad construction in 1843 and is now a quarter of its original size. Excavation of the mound in 1934 revealed that the LTM had been built in four phases.

William Cooper Nell led the charge against the segregated Smith School, facing opposition from Whites and well as from some in his own community. Over the course of more than 15 years, through a series of local petitions, protests, court cases, and ultimately a state-wide petition, Nell and others successfully convinced the legislature to outlaw public school segregation in 1855.

The Meeting House also served as a gathering space for social activism.

The granite was quarried in South Dakota, and cut in Minnesota. West Virginia graphic designers worked on the text. The paved path, shaped as a cross and series of circles, refers to Kerouac's Roman Catholic and Buddhist beliefs, and evokes his lifelong spiritual quest.

Sculpture Two is a tipped, mammoth, granite thread spool mounted on a granite base, which can also be seen as a spindle or beehive, symbolizing hard work and industry. Sculpture Three is a saw-toothed horizontal piece that might be the roofline of a boardinghouse or factory, or, perhaps, gears belonging to textile machinery.

The tour can be paired with the park’s “The Road to Revolution” Junior Ranger book.","durationMax":"2","durationMin":"1","durationUnit":"h","id":"F89958B0-C92F-0479-2D15DD245D161401","images":[{"altText":"Historic map of Boston and Cambridge","caption":"See what led this Brattle Street neighborhood down the road to revolution.","credit":"NPS Image","crops":[{"aspectRatio":1.78,"url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/primary/F8CEFC51-9A47-D9B3-90ADF352717B1C52.jpg"},{"aspectRatio":1,"url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/secondary/F8CEFC51-9A47-D9B3-90ADF352717B1C52.jpg"}],"title":"The Road to Revolution Walking Tour","url":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/F8CEFC51-9A47-D9B3-90ADF352717B1C52.jpg"}],"park":{"states":"MA","designation":"National Historic Site","parkCode":"long","fullName":"Longfellow House Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site","url":"https://www.nps.gov/long/index.htm","name":"Longfellow House Washington's Headquarters"},"relevanceScore":1,"stops":[{"significance":"John Vassall built this colonial mansion in 1759 with the money he received from the sugar industry. Vassall inherited a plantation in Jamaica and enslaved people who worked on the plantation and in this home. Vassall benefitted from his family’s status. He attended Harvard, served as a justice of the peace and was a militia officer. He was a typical British country gentleman and well respected. Until the 1770s, that is.  \n\n In March of 1770, the Boston Massacre occurred between colonists and British soldiers occupying the city. Five people were killed by the soldiers and became martyrs for a budding anti-British cause. In December 1773, during the Boston Tea Party, colonists took to the streets in protest, throwing 342 chests of tea into the harbor. Additionally, Boston colonists destroyed the governor's home, marched with effigies of government officials, and deployed intimidation tactics against merchants selling British goods. John Vassall would have heard of these unsettling events.","assetId":"E5504BAD-08BE-4D77-A674-78AF8329E140","assetName":"Longfellow House - Washington's Headquarters","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"F8FFEE56-E9D3-BE29-342D94B96D58F801","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"This is the home of Penelope and Henry Vassall, aunt and uncle of John Vassall. By September 1774, Penelope was a widow and would have looked out these windows as the turmoil reached her neighborhood.\n\nColonists had discovered that the governor had retrieved a nearby stockpile of gunpowder and brought it back to Boston. The man who gave the governor the key to the powder house was none other than William Brattle, who lived down the road. In protest, 4,000 colonists descended on Cambridge. After chasing Brattle out of town, they turned and marched down this street, passing in front of Penelope’s home. The colonist surrounded homes further down the street, demanding that the men inside resign from their government positions.\n\nTo avoid potential property damage and bloodshed, the men agreed to resign and their families fled. Penelope left for the safety of her Caribbean plantation. Both sides felt that they were the loyal British subjects upholding English liberties.

Eight months later on April 19th, 1775 two Reads marched to Lexington and Concord. This community had begun to take sides – “Loyalist” or “Patriot”- with shrinking room for the neutral.\n\nThese events did much to change the minds of the uncertain. Parliament had decided that Boston must pay for its actions and passed the Coercive Acts to compel them to cooperate.  The acts closed the port of Boston to trade, its main lifeline and limited colonists’ right to self-govern, ultimately replacing their governor with British General Gage. Instead of subduing colonists, it provoked outrage. Local Patriots saw the Powder Alarm as another tyrannical grab for power.

This was the fate of many of the abandoned properties in Cambridge.

They set their eyes on Charlestown.\n\nThe New England Army in Cambridge got wind of the plan. Colonists marched to Charlestown and dug an entrenchment on Breed's hill. The next morning, the British were surprised to see the land they intended to claim had been taken. Throughout June 16th, British forces attacked the New England army and bombarded Charlestown with cannon fire. Eventually, British soldiers overtook the hill, forcing colonists to retreat. Though they won the battle, it was at a high cost of life.\n\nFollow the northern path, just to the left of the cemetery entrance, along Garden Street.

Washington’s first headquarters, ironically, was the home of a Loyalist we already met – John Vassall.\n\nEarning the loyalty of New England soldiers would not be easy. As a Virginian, and an outsider, he harbored negative views of the soldiers and was challenged by the fact that the army was racially integrated. He eventually earned their respect, though, by forcing the British to evacuated Boston on March 17th, 1776. Washington knew that his success depended on the loyalty of his soldiers, and he made a bid for that loyalty in his first General Orders on July 14th, 1775.

This led to closing of the Blackstone Canal the following year. At a meeting of prominent industrialists in Worcester, one man proclaimed:  “The two Unions between Worcester and Providence - The first was weak as water, the last is strong as iron.” The railroad increased transportation speeds while decreasing costs. By the 1860s, the trip between Worcester to Providence was down to about an hour (the same speed that you could travel between the two locations, if going by car, today!)\nNew developments in transportation brought even more demand for local industry. When the Lonsdale Company decided to expand their operations here at Ashton, they built their new brick mill on this side of the river, taking  advantage of the quicker and cheaper transportation afforded by the railroad. The Ashton Mill was 12 times larger than the Kelly Mill and produced fine muslin cloth. Workers lived nearby in a mill village.

In the early  twentieth century, transportation technology soared to new heights. \nWith the invention of the automobile, people could live further and further away from where they worked. Many of these commuters also pushed for new road systems, which further changed landscapes such as this one. In the 1940s, the Ashton Viaduct (the large cement bridge in front of you) was completed. This viaduct, which offers a new means of crossing of the river, towers over  the centuries old crossing point. As railroads became a less significant mode of overland transportation, the modern Interstate System was established in the 1950s. The bridge you can see way off in the distance is for Interstate 295. \nConclusion \nImagine a small airplane flying under the Ashton Viaduct.

Here, Underground Railroad activists planned how they were going to help those escaping slavery.\nBlack Bostonians also gathered here in response to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which allowed slave catchers to roam free states in search of runaways and mandated the assistance of state and local authorities, as well as the public, in returning freedom seekers to slavery.\nThose who lived in this court helped shelter freedom seekers, and in one case, saved a freedom seeker from an attempted capture by a slave catcher.","assetId":"72ADD6D2-8DD5-4C21-A05E-5076F46C1199","assetName":"Smith Court, Beacon Hill","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/0132EF19-0741-5ADE-684E09F267AF10F0.mp3","id":"2DD1EE09-0CBC-664D-8741622159F78B08","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"While much of the Underground Railroad activity in Beacon Hill occurred among the Black residents of the community, there are also instances of White allies providing refuge to freedom seekers. Two of these allies, George and Susan Hillard, used their status and privilege to shelter several freedom seekers at their home.\nSusan Hillard was a staunch abolitionist and used her husband's political cover as a conservative politician to hide freedom seekers in their home throughout the 1850s. While it is unclear how much George knew of Susan’s ongoing Underground Railroad activities, he likely had some awareness and either did not interfere, or quietly supported her efforts.\nThe Hillards most notably sheltered freedom seeker Ellen Craft in October 1850 when slave catchers tracked her and her husband William to Boston. With the help of both the Hillards, Ellen and William Craft averted the slave catchers.\nWhen the home underwent repairs years later, a secret attic was found, as well as two plates and two spoons.","assetId":"3556A0B4-A970-4836-B392-6EF89A843484","assetName":"George S. and Susan Hillard House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/C726AB9C-EC95-75CC-731CA6761D732763.mp3","id":"2DE8776C-A1D3-0345-736C9FCDF30C1292","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"You are now in the Lower Southac neighborhood, so named because Phillips Street once was called Southac Street.

After growing up free in Virginia, Grimes dedicated his life to supporting freedom seekers, using his position in the Beacon Hill community to do so.\nAfter the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, more than 40 congregants of Twelfth Baptist fled north out of fear of capture.

George, on the other hand, went to Albany, New York. While there, George learned his daughter was in Boston. Reverend Grimes visited George and assured George his daughter was safe with the Thackers. Soon after, Captain Austin Bearse, brought George to the city.\nOutside this home is where father and daughter finally reunited.\nAcross the street lived Joshua Bowen Smith, known as the “Prince of Caterers.” In this high-profile position, Smith was able to keep a careful watch out for slave catchers.

Many of these businesses, including Hayden’s, became informal community centers for activists. Sometimes, these shops also served as safe houses or rendezvous points for freedom seekers.\nFreedom seeker William Craft established his cabinet making shop at 51 Cambridge Street.  When slave catchers came looking for William and his wife Ellen in October 1850, William barricaded himself in his shop.

Responding to fierce backlash, Webster called upon Massachusetts residents to enforce this law as their Constitutional duty, despite whatever misguided convictions they had.\nOnce in effect, the Fugitive Slave Law drew slave catchers to Boston in search of freedom seekers believed to be in the area.

Oftentimes, they called these meetings to protest high profile fugitive slave cases.\nFor example, in 1842, authorities arrested freedom seeker George Latimer, which prompted abolitionists to gather in Faneuil Hall to call for action against Latimer’s arrest. His case led to a petition drive that spurred the 1843 Personal Liberty Act, which prevented state officials and facilities from supporting the capture of freedom seekers.\nFollowing the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Bostonians held a meeting here to establish the Boston Vigilance Committee.

Long Wharf served as one of the primary entry points for enslaved individuals into the colony.

The African Meeting House served as a church, schoolroom, and gathering space for the community. Here, Underground Railroad activists planned how they were going to help those escaping slavery.\nBlack Bostonians also gathered here in response to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which allowed slave catchers to roam free states in search of runaways and mandated the assistance of state and local authorities, as well as the public, in returning freedom seekers to slavery.\nThose who lived in this court helped shelter freedom seekers, and in one case, saved a freedom seeker from an attempted capture by a slave catcher.","assetId":"72ADD6D2-8DD5-4C21-A05E-5076F46C1199","assetName":"Smith Court, Beacon Hill","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/0148365F-E26A-FC3E-46173D7CEADE614F.mp3","id":"97696CA1-068E-CD1A-D112FEF6E0C16EE0","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"While much of the Underground Railroad activity in Beacon Hill occurred among the Black residents of the community, there are also instances of White allies providing refuge to freedom seekers. Two of these allies, George and Susan Hillard, used their status and privilege to shelter several freedom seekers at their home.\nSusan Hillard was a staunch abolitionist and used her husband's political cover as a conservative politician to hide freedom seekers in their home throughout the 1850s. While it is unclear how much George knew of Susan’s ongoing Underground Railroad activities, he likely had some awareness and either did not interfere, or quietly supported her efforts.\nThe Hillards most notably sheltered freedom seeker Ellen Craft in October 1850 when slave catchers tracked her and her husband William to Boston. With the help of both the Hillards, Ellen and William Craft averted the slave catchers.\nWhen the home underwent repairs years later, a secret attic was found, as well as two plates and two spoons.","assetId":"3556A0B4-A970-4836-B392-6EF89A843484","assetName":"George S. and Susan Hillard House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/C73B9ED8-D4D8-AD2B-78F9B2BCACEB8403.mp3","id":"977C6937-9A30-6DA7-D736D55E964BDFAD","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"You are now in the Lower Southac neighborhood, so named because Phillips Street once was called Southac Street.

Riley sheltered freedom seeker Shadrach Minkins in her attic after he was rescued from the courthouse.\nThe Riley home also included 1 Southac Court, where famed freedom seeker Jane Johnson and her sons lived. Johnson took in other freedoms seekers at her home here on Southac Court and at her later Beacon Hill residences.\nAcross the street stands 81-83 Phillips Street.

After growing up free in Virginia, Grimes dedicated his life to supporting freedom seekers, using his position in the Beacon Hill community to do so.\nAfter the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, more than 40 congregants of Twelfth Baptist fled north out of fear of capture. Grimes raised money to pay for many of these individuals’ freedoms and supported many more freedom seekers on their journey.\nGrimes played a role in almost every major fugitive slave case in Boston in the 1850s, as some of these freedom seekers, including Shadrach Minkins and Anthony Burns, worshipped at Twelfth Baptist.\nToday, there is a plaque at the site of Leonard Grimes’ 28 Grove St. home.","assetId":"480971F5-69DE-41E1-B7B3-95F91FB12A2D","assetName":"Site of Twelfth Baptist Church","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/CAC56731-B413-C913-F226F80AB279A6C2.mp3","id":"9791FFBD-A8E8-DE59-A033544D29A6ED90","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Here at 5 Phillips Street once stood the home of Henry Thacker, a prominent Black caterer and activist.

George, on the other hand, went to Albany, New York. While there, George learned his daughter was in Boston. Reverend Grimes visited George and assured George his daughter was safe with the Thackers. Soon after, Captain Austin Bearse, brought George to the city.\nOutside this home is where father and daughter finally reunited.\nAcross the street lived Joshua Bowen Smith, known as the “Prince of Caterers.” In this high-profile position, Smith was able to keep a careful watch out for slave catchers.

Many of these businesses, including Hayden’s, became informal community centers for activists. Sometimes, these shops also served as safe houses or rendezvous points for freedom seekers.\nFreedom seeker William Craft established his cabinet making shop at 51 Cambridge Street.  When slave catchers came looking for William and his wife Ellen in October 1850, William barricaded himself in his shop.

Responding to fierce backlash, Webster called upon Massachusetts residents to enforce this law as their Constitutional duty, despite whatever misguided convictions they had.\nOnce in effect, the Fugitive Slave Law drew slave catchers to Boston in search of freedom seekers believed to be in the area.

Oftentimes, they called these meetings to protest high profile fugitive slave cases.\nFor example, in 1842, authorities arrested freedom seeker George Latimer, which prompted abolitionists to gather in Faneuil Hall to call for action against Latimer’s arrest. His case led to a petition drive that spurred the 1843 Personal Liberty Act, which prevented state officials and facilities from supporting the capture of freedom seekers.\nFollowing the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, Bostonians held a meeting here to establish the Boston Vigilance Committee.

Made of Weber Sandstone, it is another ancient desert sand dune formation that is even older than the dinosaurs. Two of its features provided\nresources for Josie.

She simply fenced the narrow open ends and let the canyon walls confine her livestock. Josie also needed water for her livestock. The porous Weber sandstone absorbs rain and snowmelt. The water eventually emerges as springs in the canyons. While a blessing, the springs from Box and Hog canyons also gave Josie some headaches because of water use laws.

Completed in 1853 the Orange Plank Road partially replaced the Orange Turnpike as the main route west out of Fredericksburg.

In some places the Plank Road used the same route as the Turnpike, but in others is diverged to make use of better ground. Just to the east of the battlefield is one of the places where the older Turnpike and newer Plank Road diverged from each other, creating the parallel roads the battle formed along.\n\nBy 1864 the road was in disrepair.

The roads leading south to Richmond had brought the US Army to the area in 1862 for the Battle of Fredericksburg. Roads and intersections at Chancelorsville made Jackson’s famous flank attack possible, while their absence from Hooker’s maps left him ignorant to their possibility.  Without the many road junctions at Gettysburg there may never have been a battle there at all.\n\nThe Wilderness too had its intersections, none more important than where the Orange Plank Road and Brock Road met. On the first day of the Battle of the Wilderness, capture of the Orange Plank Road by Confederates would have spelled doom for the US Army’s efforts. The fact that the Confederates failed to capture the intersection ensured that the campaign would not end here.","assetId":"CE8B84C3-487E-46C8-B283-95D459990D42","assetName":"Brock Road-Plank Road Intersection","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/35AA84E2-B66A-B2F2-9BDA255C6E9748F4.mp3","id":"CD3180FE-DEA2-B675-5064E31D7BA78220","ordinal":"8","directionToNextStop":""}],"title":"Wilderness: Driving Tour","topics":[{"id":"D9FC6D14-F8C7-4EBA-86EA-DFD99B6BB4F5","name":"Enslavement"},{"id":"1F833C99-A75D-4F9E-9256-B96523485466","name":"Farming and  Agriculture"},{"id":"F67CA03D-109F-44B9-9B63-D9EC9FD77A1D","name":"Plantations"},{"id":"3B0D607D-9933-425A-BFA0-21529AC4734C","name":"Military"},{"id":"B145FAB8-5462-4FE2-964E-464D3A5E7F96","name":"Artillery"},{"id":"97CCB419-196C-4B95-BB3A-621458F78415","name":"US Army"},{"id":"6A3658B4-FB6E-4E23-A63A-9AEF11988831","name":"Battlefields"},{"id":"BEB7E470-13B2-4E00-84B2-0402D98DAF69","name":"Monuments and Memorials"},{"id":"A160B3D9-1603-4D89-B82F-21FCAF9EEE3B","name":"Tragic Events"},{"id":"C373F02B-7335-4F8A-A3ED-3E2E37CD4085","name":"Catastrophic Fires"},{"id":"27BF8807-54EA-4A3D-B073-AA7AA361CD7E","name":"Wars and Conflicts"},{"id":"A8E54356-20CD-490E-B34D-AC6A430E6F47","name":"Civil War"}]},{"activities":[{"id":"B33DC9B6-0B7D-4322-BAD7-A13A34C584A3","name":"Guided Tours"},{"id":"A0631906-9672-4583-91DE-113B93DB6B6E","name":"Self-Guided Tours - Walking"},{"id":"BFF8C027-7C8F-480B-A5F8-CD8CE490BFBA","name":"Hiking"}],"description":"In this family-friendly short walking tour, learn about the subalpine ecosystem of Logan Pass that is home to creatures with amazing abilities.

Join us as we stroll through the historic district of Beacon Hill and explore stories of the innovative and inspiring women who made a difference in this community.","assetId":"BE126BB7-DF9E-4B75-926D-1266526767BB","assetName":"Massachusetts State House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/366C172F-CA27-13AE-0FFB38CE75951664.mp3","id":"3522935C-AAE5-438D-948C4CF1866EFBB8","ordinal":"1","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"During the summer of 1836, Mary Aves Slater traveled from her home in New Orleans to visit her father Thomas Aves in Boston. Slater brought a six-year-old enslaved girl named Med with her, leaving Med’s mother behind in New Orleans.\nThe Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society soon learned of the enslavement of Med in the home of Thomas Aves at 21 Pinckney Street. Member Lydia Maria Child recalled, “We obtained all the evidence we wanted, carried it to a lawyer, who petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus; the judge granted the petition; and  the man who held little Med in custody was brought up for trial.”\nAlthough Slater legally owned Med in New Orleans, Judge Lemuel Shaw granted Med her freedom on the basis that enslaved people brought to the free state of Massachusetts could not be held against their will. The Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society's success in freeing Med was short-lived; two years later Med died in the Samaritan Asylum for Indigent Children in Boston, before being reunited with her mother.","assetId":"E3725D7C-FE3F-4D3C-8DB2-52D3F7779B00","assetName":"Site of Thomas Aves Home","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/367448C9-0DAA-EE6B-686EF317A10FC2B1.mp3","id":"352A0C28-9942-F6C8-0D55B396634E47AB","ordinal":"2","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"The success of the Underground Railroad in Boston required the collective efforts of Black and White women. Each group used their unique position in society as dictated by their gender and race to support their singular cause. As the Boston Evening Transcript recalled, “Frequently it became too hazardous to board fugitives among their own people…Under such circumstance safe harborages were found without expense among the white abolitionists. One such refuge was in the house of George S. Hillard at 62 Pinckney street.” Throughout the 1850s, George’s wife Susan routinely welcomed freedom seekers into her home, using her husband’s reputation as a Websterian politician to conceal her work with the Underground Railroad. Most notably, Susan Hillard sheltered Ellen Craft in October 1850 as slave catchers searched Beacon Hill for the freedom seeker.","assetId":"3556A0B4-A970-4836-B392-6EF89A843484","assetName":"George S. and Susan Hillard House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/66559E75-D346-52DA-E6AF901E2369B398.mp3","id":"352FD6D1-9B3B-3825-5F6C64513E6FC14F","ordinal":"3","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"In the summer of 1895, Black clubwomen traveled to Boston to attend the First National Conference of the Colored Women of America. Largely organized by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and members of the Boston-based Black women’s club, the Women’s Era Club, most of the conference took place in Berkeley Hall. The convention provided a space for club delegates “to talk over not only those things which are of vital importance to us as colored women;” but to also “teach an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women.” \n\nOn the final day, clubwomen met at the Charles Street Meeting House to form the National Federation of Afro-American Women. Later, this group merged with the National League of Colored Women to form what is now known as the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs. This conference proved pivotal in shaping the way society viewed Black women and laid out the foundation for the advancement of the Black women’s club movement.","assetId":"839526C4-A620-438D-9605-5C550D3DD29E","assetName":"Charles Street Meeting House","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/368B1802-0C7C-1F5A-AF1215E8161DA6CE.mp3","id":"35360215-CFA9-E30A-2C1DD353AE770749","ordinal":"4","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"As a center of activism, Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin’s Charles Street home always brimmed with energy.

Through events and activities, the club encouraged the intellectual engagement of its members, addressed needs in the community, and maintained a broad vision for equality and social change. Members advocated for greater civil rights for African Americans, supported women’s suffrage, and stood against racism and discrimination. The club’s vision for a world in which Black women took active roles in bettering their communities extended across the country through the club’s nationally published newspaper, 'The Woman’s Era.'","assetId":"6EDE0D33-AF56-4FBF-B04E-3233800AE5A1","assetName":"Meeting Place of the Woman's Era Club","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/3695C487-B6D6-197B-950571E3DABB2B9B.mp3","id":"35423B63-0B37-3C5B-3EA37DD1046F957D","ordinal":"5","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Following her escape from enslavement in 1844, Harriet Hayden and her family moved to their home here at 66 Phillips Street, formerly Southac Street, in 1848.

For over a decade, Harriet regularly welcomed freedom seekers, providing food, clothing, shelter, and information. Following Harriet’s death in 1893, 'The Woman’s Journal' published a moving remembrance, “Her bright, cheerful spirit and quaint, original utterances were an unfailing source of comfort and cheer in the darkest hours of the struggle. No history of that time will be complete without the name of Harriet Hayden and a record of the vigorous part she played.” In her will, Harriet left a sum of $5000 to Harvard Medical School for the establishment of a scholarship for Black students.

While largely unremembered today, Arianna Sparrow took an active role in the Beacon Hill community, particularly in the women’s suffrage and anti-lynching movements at the end of the 19th century. In the 1880s, she helped organize suffrage events throughout Beacon Hill, and she served as a member of the Executive Committee for the West End Woman Suffrage League, a primarily-Black chapter of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association.  \n\nWhile a member of the Woman’s Era Club, Arianna Sparrow became involved in the anti-lynching movement. In 1899, Sparrow joined a group of notable Black and White women leaders, many former abolitionists and current suffragists, in calling for a mass meeting to protest against lynching.

Born around 1844 to an African American father and a Chippewa mother, Lewis moved to Boston in 1864 to pursue a career in art. Inspired by Boston’s abolitionist community, her artwork showcased the courage of leaders such as John Brown and Wendell Phillips. While supported by local abolitionists, Lewis felt limited by her race in the United States as she declared, “The land of liberty had no room for a colored sculptor.” Eventually settling in Rome in 1865, Edmonia Lewis broke through racial and gender barriers and gained international recognition as a sculptor. On a return visit to Boston, Black abolitionist leaders held a reception for her at the Twelfth Baptist Church in December 1869.","assetId":"480971F5-69DE-41E1-B7B3-95F91FB12A2D","assetName":"Site of Twelfth Baptist Church","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/tours/370194FC-EEDE-E079-C9A1FA7A88FBD92E.mp3","id":"3560A862-9EC0-034E-617B36EB9EBDD877","ordinal":"8","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"As a Black woman born circa 1812 in Wilmington, North Carolina, Clara Vaught likely began her life enslaved.  \n\nIt can be inferred that between 1812 and 1852, Vaught escaped enslavement and ultimately settled in Boston.

As an experiment in construction methods, it was built with mostly fireproof materials. Instead of wood, concrete and granite were textured and stained to resemble redwood. The design combines rustic and art deco influences. The massing of a central tower and two wings, forming a “Y” shape, is unusual compared to other rustic-era park lodges. The vertical granite buttresses, piers, and chimneys reflect the granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley.\n\nIn the original design, visitors would enter through the modern-day bar area. Shortly before the opening date, staff noticed that this entrance caused vehicle fumes to fill the hotel. Instead, contractors quickly constructed the covered walkway and porte-cochere entrance in use today.\n\nDrs. Phyllis Ackerman and Arthur Pope, renowned art historians, decorated the interior primarily with a bold array of American Indian art of the day. Ansel Adams aptly described the decor as a “miracle of color and design.”","assetId":"23CD1135-0989-47CE-8896-9A910E7B1FAA","assetName":"The Ahwahnee","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"0A3558DD-079B-DDB3-AA4B7101CD3B9BD3","ordinal":"8","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"This large, multi-purpose building has served a variety of functions since its construction.

Donohue agreed to the National Park Service’s request to construct a modern facility, continuing the Degnan’s legacy. Donohue partnered with well-known mid-century modern architect Frank Lloyd Wright to draft a design for the new Degnan’s building. The National Park Service rejected the proposed design, deeming it too futuristic. Director Conrad Wirth famously critiqued Wright’s design by calling it “a mushroom dome type of thing.”\n\nWalter Wagner and Partners designed the distinct A-frame structure we know today. Its floor-to-ceiling windows are a signature of mid-century park designs, and the prominent wood elements and interior fireplace resemble a mountain lodge.","assetId":"666DD439-2FE0-4104-8671-4CA5F79C8D80","assetName":"Degnan's Kitchen","assetType":"places","audioFileUrl":"","id":"0A3DD2FC-FAAA-09BE-3423808BBA6C863D","ordinal":"10","directionToNextStop":""},{"significance":"Designed by architect Herbert Maier, who also designed the Museum, the Post Office was completed in 1925.\n\nThis building is the first in this tour of a trio of buildings that possess a very similar aesthetic.

The large window walls allow natural light and scenery to reach visitors indoors. Steel framing and glass windows are unobtrusive and blend with the natural environment.
